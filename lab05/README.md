Who did you work with (if anyone): By myself

How long did this take you?  2 hours

Write a sentence or two about what file you chose to clean up, and note something about what the most common or annoying issue you had to fix. 

I chose the sort2.c to clean. And I clean it into sort2_clean.c .

The most common issue is, I used to give a single new line to put '{', but
this program told me that I should put '{' at the end of the old line.
