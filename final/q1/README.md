Question 1

===========

Problem Statement: Complete the code by providing an implementation for the functions defined in the generic.h
file.

============

This problem is meant to test your basic programming and problem solving skills. You should not need to use any
libraries or special functions to solve this problem, though you are allowed to. Implement the functions in the
generic.c file and use the main function block to test your logic (tests will not be graded). Once done, there should be
no memory leaks.
