Welcome to the CS5008 final and well done on making it this far. Whether you realize it or not, you've grown this
semester and are that much closer to your internship, graduation, and a career as a software engineer.

Just like the course, this final is meant to be practical. My goal is to evaluate your technical growth specific to the
content we've covered this semester. While
previous quizzes have tested your theoretical knowledge, this exam will test your ability to problem solve and apply
what you've learned.

Each question is recursive and there are no zero-sum games. This essentially means you can get partial credit. Each
directly has a question-specific README.md associated with it where you'll find the problem statment, the rubric, and
other useful bits of information.

You are allowed to use [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/index.htm) website for documentation
purposes. You are NOT allowed to use notes or any other forms aid. If you find the above website lacking, please raise
your hand and let me know.

Academic dishonesty is prohibited. Students found in violation of the Academic Integrity Policy will be
placed on deferred suspension by the college.  Please see
[here](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/computer-information-science/academic-policies-procedures/academic-integrity/) for the full readout of Khoury's policy.

After you complete your exam, you are free to go. Thankj you for your time and effort this semester. Trust me when I
tell you it all goes by very fast. You'll be crushing it as an engineer before you know it.

Good luck and feel free to keep in touch!
