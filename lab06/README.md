# Lab 6: Testing with Google Test suite
## CS 5008: Spring 2021

This lab walks through setting up and utilizing the Google Test framework for C and C++. 

The details are in the lab write-up, but here's an overview: 

* Run ```make``` to build the program and install the Google library. 
* Run ```make test``` to run the test suite. 

Now, go through the code in ```example1.c``` and ```test_example.cc``` to 
find instructions on what to change. An easy way to find everything is 
to use the following command: 

```
grep STEP *.c *.cc
```
