Working with Pointers

The intro to Pointers and Memory by Nick Parlante is a good refresher (Sections 1, 2, 3).

Create a file named something like pointers.c in an a2 folder. Use this to practice with the code in the readings (either by Parlante or the Yale notes). Check this in so we can see your progress.

Part A: Check out starter code and copy into your repo (simply clone course resources and copy the entire a3 folder over using the cp command)

The CS 5008 Course_Resources repo has some starter code for this assignment. Check it out (clone into its own folder/local repo), and copy the files from the a2 folder over to your own personal repo.

Part B: Work with structs and the string library

We briefly introduced structs in class this week. In the assignment, start playing around with structs.

In the provided .h file, we have provided a definition for a struct named Name.
