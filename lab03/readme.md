Who did you work with (if anyone)

By myself

How long did this take you?

1 hour

The first version, errors.c, has...errors! If you use Valgrind and run the executable, you'll see something like this:

-bash-4.2$ gcc errors.c -o errors -g

-bash-4.2$ valgrind --leak-check=full ./errors

==186017== ERROR SUMMARY: 2 errors from 2 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

You can see that there were 2 errors: use of an uninitialized value and a leak.

Now try no_errors.c. You should see output like this:

-bash-4.2$ gcc no_errors.c -o no_errors -g

-bash-4.2$ valgrind --leak-check=full ./no_errors

No errorsâ€”WHOO! There are comments in the code that explain how the errors were fixed, essentially: we avoided using an uninitialized variable and freed the memory we had allocated for the string. This is the result you want for your programs: no errors, no leaks.
